## match_results
This is my solution for a simple code problem from SoloLearn, where I learned a lot about the language.
For example, concurrency in Go, arrays, maps, and other collections, and expanded my knowledge on pointers.

The problem itself can be found in the link below. It's behind a login/registration page, so I'm not 100% certain if I can share the actual problem text. 
To create an account is a rather simple process. The basic problem can be described however: calculate the total amount of points based on the array.
